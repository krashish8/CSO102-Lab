This repository contains the Lab and Assignment files of the course Data Structures and Algorithms (CSO102) at IIT BHU Varanasi - Even Semester 2018-19
> **Guided By**: [Dr. Sanjay Kumar Singh](https://iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/skscse), Professor, CSE, IIT (BHU) Varanasi.

**Contents:**

1. [Lab 1](lab-01.c): Find mean, median, mode and standard deviation of a given dataset using an array.
2. [Lab 2](lab-02.c): Find the highest number in a given matrix.
3. [Lab 3](lab-03.c): Find the second largest element in an array.
4. [Lab 4(i)](lab-04-i.c): Reverse (i) an array without using extra space.
   [Lab 4(ii)](lab-04-ii.c): Reverse (ii) a string without using extra space.
5. [Lab 5](lab-05a.c): Display sine wave of given amplitude and no. of asterisks per 180 degree phase.
6. [Lab 6](lab-06a.c): Implement two stack using 1-D array where the total size of both stacks are fixed but individual size may differ (use Dynamic Memory allocation and structure concepts)
7. [Lab 7](lab-07.c): Use stack operations to convert given infix expression into its postfix equivalent. Implement the stack using an array.
8. [Lab 8](lab-08.c): Use functions to perform the following operations:
	(a) Create a singly linked list of integers.
	(b) Delete a given integer from the above list.
	(c) Display the contents of the above list after deletion
9. [Lab 9(a)](lab-09a.c): Implement double ended queue ADT using (a) Array.
   [Lab 9(b)](lab-09b.c): Implement double ended queue ADT using (b) Doubly Linked List.
10. [Lab 10](lab-10.c): Use functions to perform the following operations:
	(a) Create a binary search tree of characters
	(b) Traverse the binary tree recursively in postorder, preorder and inorder.
11. [Lab 11](lab-11.c): Implement Priority Queue using BInary Heap.
12. [Lab 12](lab-12.c): Check whether two trees are symmetric or not and also find that given tree is BST or not.
13. [Lab 13](lab-13.c): Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing.
14. [Lab 14](lab-14.c): Implement graph traversal algorithms:
	(i) Depth First search.
	(ii) Breadth First search.
	(iii) Topological sort on DAG using DFS

* [DS Assignment](ds_assignment.c): Find LCA (Least Common Ancestor) of two given nodes in a tree given the child-parent relationship.
* [Linked List Implementation](linked_list.c).
